# Infra Shield Tools (IST)

## Overview

Infra Shield Tools (IST) is a web application for selling and distributing security verification scripts for various operating systems (Windows, Linux, VMware ESXi, Docker). Users can browse available scripts, purchase them via Stripe payments (subscription-based), and download purchased scripts. The application features local email/password authentication and includes an admin panel for user management.

**Domain**: ist-security.fr (planned)

## Security Scripts

### Linux Compliance Toolkit (ANSSI-BP-028 + CIS Benchmark)
- **Base Script** (~55 controls): Based on ANSSI-BP-028 + CIS Level 1 recommendations
- **Enhanced Script** (~100 controls): Based on ANSSI-BP-028 + CIS Level 2 recommendations  
- **Toolkit Bundle**: Both scripts bundled together at 30% discount

Scripts generate HTML/JSON reports with scores, grades, and remediation recommendations based on ANSSI and CIS compliance standards.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight router)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme variables
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Build Tool**: Vite with path aliases (@/, @shared/, @assets/)

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Server**: Node.js with HTTP server
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints defined in shared/routes.ts with Zod validation
- **Authentication**: Replit OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration with Passport.js
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions via connect-pg-simple

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with drizzle-zod for schema validation
- **Schema Location**: shared/schema.ts (shared between frontend and backend)
- **Key Tables**:
  - `users` - User accounts with admin flags and Stripe customer IDs
  - `sessions` - Session storage for authentication
  - `scripts` - Security scripts catalog with pricing
  - `purchases` - User purchase records with subscription tracking
  - `invoices` - Admin-generated invoices for customers
  - `invoice_items` - Line items for each invoice
  - `script_controls` - Dynamic security controls for scripts
  - `machines` - Registered machines for fleet tracking
  - `audit_reports` - Uploaded audit report history per machine

### Fleet Tracking (Suivi du Parc)
- **Location**: /suivi page with fixed left sidebar navigation
- **Access Control**: Requires team membership (owner, admin, or member)
- **Features**:
  - Dashboard with statistics (machines count, reports count, average score)
  - Machines list with OS, last audit date, and score
  - Reports list with detailed audit information
  - JSON report upload with automatic machine detection
  - Team member management access
- **Upload Process**:
  - User uploads JSON report file generated by audit scripts
  - System parses JSON to extract: hostname, OS, score, controls
  - Auto-creates or updates machine record
  - Stores full report for historical tracking
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/fleet/machines` - List machines for user's team
  - `GET /api/fleet/reports` - List audit reports for user's team
  - `POST /api/fleet/upload-report` - Upload new JSON report
  - `GET /api/fleet/stats` - Dashboard statistics
  - `DELETE /api/fleet/machines/:id` - Delete machine and reports
  - `DELETE /api/fleet/reports/:id` - Delete single report

### Invoice Management
- Admin-only feature for creating and managing invoices
- Invoice workflow: draft -> sent -> paid (with cancelled/overdue states)
- Invoice number format: IST-YYYYMM-XXXX (auto-generated)
- Server-side calculation of subtotals, tax (TVA), and totals
- Support for custom tax rates per invoice
- Associated with scripts/toolkits for tracking purchases
- **Automatic email sending**: Invoices are sent via email when status changes to "sent"

### Email Integration (Resend)
- **Provider**: Resend (via Replit Connector)
- **Automatic Subscription Invoices**: Email sent automatically on Stripe subscription renewal (invoice.paid webhook)
- **Manual Invoice Emails**: Sent when admin changes invoice status to "sent"
- **Email Templates**: Professional HTML templates with IST branding
- **Email Service File**: server/email.ts

### Authentication Flow
- Dual authentication: Replit Auth via OIDC and local email/password
- Local auth uses bcrypt for password hashing with session regeneration for security
- First registered user automatically becomes admin
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL session store
- Protected routes use `isAuthenticated` middleware
- Profile page at /profile for updating name/email/password (local users only)
- **TODO**: Email verification for email changes requires Resend integration to be configured

### Payment Integration
- **Provider**: Stripe (via Replit Connector)
- **Payment Types**: One-time purchases and monthly subscriptions
- **Webhook Handling**: Automated via stripe-replit-sync package
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic production/development mode switching
